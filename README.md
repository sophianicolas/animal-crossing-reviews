# animal-crossing-reviews
# Neural Network Approach
An alternative to my sentiment analysis project on user reviews for Animal Crossing New Horizons using a neural network, the original version being based on clustering and random forest algorithms.

This branch (neural-network-version) contains a neural network approach to solve the task of classifying ACNH user reviews as either positive or negative. 

This version of the project was actually created in March-April 2025 for the NLP class I took the following semester.

Included is a Jupyter notebook containing the neural network code, a CSV file containing user review data, and a PDF report describing the process and results.

Had a lot of fun with this and learned so much!

The Animal Crossing Reviews dataset is from Jesse Montipak on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/animal-crossing/data
