# animal-crossing-reviews
Sentiment analysis of user reviews for Animal Crossing New Horizons, created in November 2024-December 2024 as my final project for the machine learning class I took in university.

This branch (results-stage-one) contains the initial "Stage One" phase of this project. Here, I was figuring out overall problem solving structure and what algorithms I wanted to use for classification, beginning with the desire to learn about clustering and word cloud representation.

Included is a Jupyter notebook containing Stage One code, another Jupyter notebook containing a lab for clustering algorithm development, a CSV file containing user review data, a PDF report describing initial process and results, and a PDF of my presentation slides.

Had a lot of fun with this and learned so much!

The Animal Crossing Reviews dataset is from Jesse Montipak on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/animal-crossing/data

Images used as graphics for my presentation were found on Pinterest.
