# animal-crossing-reviews
Sentiment analysis of user reviews for Animal Crossing New Horizons, created in November 2024-December 2024 as my final project for the machine learning class I took in university. 

This branch (main) contains the final project results using random forest and clustering for classifying reviews as either positive or negative.

Included is a Jupyter notebook containing approach code, a CSV file containing user review data, a PDF report describing the process and results, and a PDF of my presentation slides.

Had a lot of fun with this and learned so much!

The Animal Crossing Reviews dataset is from Jesse Montipak on Kaggle:

Images used as graphics for my presentation were found on Pinterest.
