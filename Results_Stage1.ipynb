Way many times missed a glowing spot they're hidden behind a building something. great you've included the end-of-game mechanic, isn't named spoiler warnings, think should become part the core game mechanic.The DIY crafting menu sucks, so the inventory menu. say trying craft items sell make a ton bells. Sure, can mash speed the crafting process, what want stress the button you already spam fishing? Gotta fork money buy a controller turbo, something. much rather the option craft multiple items once. Speaking multiple items once, also hurt change people divide stacks inventory. need select the item, select grab one order move separate something a stack, only one a time. It'd great indicate many we would separate said stack save time. worth mentioning, think the game's worth $60. a reasoning behind this, but...
